      "body": "The first time I heard the title the thought that crossed my mind was that it could be used to support more modes of UDP usage that focus on listening - such as multicast reception.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I look at the draft, the interaction model doesn't really fit the multicast subscribe/join model. (I can think of ways to do that but I won't waste your time here).\r\n\r\nAssuming you want to keep the document scope and design as is, I might suggest a tweak to the document title that more closely matches that definition. Maybe something like \"UDP socket multiplexing over single HTTP requests\" :bike::shed\"\r\n\r\n",
